# Anomaly_project â€” Attack Detection in Multi-Tenant Cloud Systems

A machine learning pipeline for detecting malicious tenants in multi-tenant distributed systems using ensemble-based meta-classification and custom data balancing techniques.

> This project is based on our research paper published in the *International Journal on Recent and Innovation Trends in Computing and Communication (IJRITCC), Vol. 11, Issue 9, 2023.*

## Abstract

Cloud-based multi-tenant systems, while efficient and scalable, are prone to vulnerabilities due to shared infrastructure. This project proposes a **weighted ensemble learning approach** to predict attacks from tenants by analyzing system parameter patterns. It addresses challenges like **dataset scarcity**, **feature redundancy**, and **class imbalance** by:
- Generating a custom dataset with over **50,000 timeframes**
- Applying **oversampling and undersampling** for class balancing
- Training multiple classifiers and combining them via **weighted averaging**

---

## Key Features

- Custom cloud-attack dataset generation via virtualized environment
- Handling class imbalance using RandomOverSampler and RandomUnderSampler
- Feature selection to reduce dimensionality and prevent overfitting
- Models used: Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes, Multi-layer Perceptron (ANN)
- Final prediction via **weighted average ensemble**
- Evaluation via Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score

---

## Dataset

The dataset includes over **55,000 labeled entries** with key features:
- `app_cpu_netdata_x`
- `app_cpu_apps.plugin_x`
- `app_cpu_tc-qos-helper_x`
- `app_cpu_ssh_x`
- `running`, `freeused`, `cached`, `buffers`

Class labels:
- `0`: Normal tenant
- `1`: Malicious tenant (attack instance)

Balancing Strategy:
- Oversampled minority class using `RandomOverSampler`
- Undersampled majority class using `RandomUnderSampler`
- Achieved final ratio: ~1.25:1 (non-attack:attack)
